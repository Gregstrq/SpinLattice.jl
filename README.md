# SpinLattice

Package to facilitate first-principles calculation of the free induction decay of nuclear spins in solids.
This is an old version restricted to Julia version 0.6.x. I am working on rewriting the package for the current versions of Julia, while simultaneously making it more modular. The package LightLattices.jl was born out of this effort.
